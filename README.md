# Test Text-Fabric Version with Multi-Punctuated Sentences 

This dataset only contains the Greek text of the Gospel of John (N1904)

The source data for this test TF dataset is available in the following repository: [John Punctuation Browser](https://tonyjurg.github.io/John-punctuation-browser/).

In this dataset, the standard Text-Fabric methods `A.search()` and `A.show()` have been modified to operate on a combined set of alternative punctuation schemes. Since this is a demonstration version, additional diagnostic messages are printed when these methods are used.

The method used to modify these functions (along with a discussion of alternative approaches that were considered and ultimately rejected) is documented [here](https://github.com/tonyjurg/TF_function_replace_demo).

# About Text-Fabric

The Text-Fabric framework is designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. The engine of Text-Fabric is its powerful Python library, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).
