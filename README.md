# Test TF Version with Multi-Punctuated Sentences 

This dataset only contains the Greek text of the Gospel of John (N1904)

The source data for this test TF dataset is available in the following repository: [John Punctuation Browser](https://tonyjurg.github.io/John-punctuation-browser/).

In this dataset, the standard Text-Fabric methods `A.search()` and `A.show()` have been modified to operate on a combined set of alternative punctuation schemes. Since this is a demonstration version, additional diagnostic messages are printed when these methods are used.

The method used to modify these functions (along with a discussion of alternative approaches that were considered and ultimately rejected) is documented [here](https://github.com/tonyjurg/TF_function_replace_demo).
